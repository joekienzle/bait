Ever had to manually enter everything when paying a bill? Reading complicated billing numbers and bank account info sucks and you shouldn't be bothered with quadruple checking these infos. This is where Bait kicks in. With the Bank account information transfer (Bait) you can make the process easier: As the bill creater you enter your account information and print a QR code onto the bill, so the receiver can scan it with a mobile device and have the data right at hand. No more nasty typing in numbers by hand and transfering money becomes a little safer. 

## But why bother when systems like PayPal offer more?

This service offers organisations that want to print and send bills via mail a way to make the payment process easier for them and their customers.

## So when is this ready?

Bait is still under development. So stay tuned for whats coming.
