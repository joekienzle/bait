Ever had to manually enter everything manually when paying a bill? Entering this manually with non readable billing numbers and bank account info sucks and you shouldn't have to quadruple check the numbers. This is where Bait kicks in. With the Bank account information transfer (Bait) you can make the process easier in two steps: As the bill creater you enter your info from your system and print a QR code onto the bill so the receiver of the bill can scan it with a mobile device. No more nasty typing and transfering money becomes a little safer. 

## But why bother when systems like PayPal offer more?

This service offers organisations that want to print and send bills via mail a way to make the payment process easier for them and their customers.

## So when is this ready?

Bait is still under development. So stay tuned for whats coming.
